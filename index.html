                <dt><h2>Atomic Habits</h2><h3> &emsp; James Clear &emsp; &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; </h3></dt>
                <dd>Genres : &emsp; Self Help &emsp; Discipline &emsp; Motivation</h3>I am giving my true review
                    This book delves deep into the power of small habits and their ability to make a big impact on our lives. It offers practical strategies and insightful anecdotes to help readers understand how to build and break habits effectively.<br>
                    One significant aspect of this book is the author's emphasis on the idea that change does not occur overnight, but rather through the accumulation of small, consistent actions. He outlines a simple yet powerful framework, the four laws of behavior change, consisting of making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. These laws, when applied properly, can help readers create desirable habits and eliminate undesirable ones.<br>
                    The author backs up his claims and advice with scientific research and studies, which I appreciated. By illustrating the psychology and neuroscience behind habit formation, he provides a solid foundation and credibility for his suggestions. This evidence-based approach adds weight to the ideas presented, making them more compelling and trustworthy.<br>
                    What sets Atomic Habits apart from other self-help books is its practicality. Instead of merely discussing theories and concepts, the author goes a step further and offers actionable steps for readers to implement his strategies. He breaks down the process of habit formation into easy-to-follow steps, making it more likely for readers to take action and see real progress. Additionally, he provides various techniques to overcome common stumbling blocks along the way, such as habit stacking and habit tracking, making it easier for readers to stay on track.<br>
                    The author's writing style is engaging and easy to understand. He uses relatable anecdotes and compelling examples to illustrate his points, which kept me hooked from the beginning until the end. The book is organized in a logical and coherent manner, making it easy to refer back to specific chapters or sections when needed.
                    Atomic Habits is a must-read for anyone looking to improve their lives by harnessing the power of habit. For those who are seeking personal growth, better productivity, or healthier habits, this book offers invaluable insights that can help you reach your goals</dd>
                <dt>><h2>Killers of the Flower Moon</h2><h3> &emsp; Martin Scorsis &emsp; &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; </h3></dt>
                <dd>Genres : &emsp; Self Help &emsp; Discipline &emsp; Motivation</h3>
                    I have put 5 stars without even watching it as the trailer alone and soundtrack on top of the fact its Scorcese, Di Caprio and De Niro plus other great Actors and Actresses is enough for me to already know its going to be an award winning film infact multiple award winning's for Movie, Picture, Soundtrack, Actors and Actresses everything that movies can get awards for. All the people involved in the making of this movie and from everything I have read up on the actual true story and movie Scorcese has kept it as factual as you can get or as close to it as you will ever get according to a lot of film judges if you like, like Rotten Tomatoes ect unlike many others who miss a lot of facts out ruining the movie especially if you know the true story already by reading up on it all before watching the movie and it won't spoil it as I generally read up the true story before factual movies anyway. I love the long movies not the 1 hour 30 minute movies or less. The long ones are usually epics in my experience and the best one's especially by directors, Producers and Actors like this. Sometimes you don't want the movie's to end lol thanks for the great reviews they helped a lot too and there are many great reviews by people here. I will be back in the near future with another review after watching a few times which no doubt I will lol.<br></dd>
                <dt><h2>Middle of the NIGHT</h2><h3> &emsp; Riley Sagar &emsp; &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; </h3></dt></dt>
                <dd>3.5* rounded up. I definitely enjoyed this, but I didn’t love it as much as I’d hoped to. This one felt like a pretty solid “middle-of-the-road” thriller to me. Not terrible, not great. I thought it had potential to be amazing, especially in the beginning, I was LOVING where I *thought* it was going but it just didn’t have me in the same chokehold as some of his others! I still recommend it though, it’s got great 90s nostalgia sprinkled in and an unpredictable twist for sure! Good for a summer popcorn thriller.<br></dd>
